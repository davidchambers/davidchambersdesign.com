             worked on a poster for a presentation. He is an engineer;
             using Illustrator was a new experience for him. He generally
             picks up new things easily, but as you may appreciate,
             Illustrator is often far from logical. We reached a point
             where he asked me about scaling rounded rectangles â€“ this
             is where things started to get hairy."])

             way to stop it from changing the rounding of the corners
             (which I want constant for all my rectangles)?"

            "you can work out how large you want it to be and then
             double-click with the rectangle tool and you'll be able
             to enter all the correct values"

            "is there a way to change how curved they are after placing them?"

            "InDesign has a much better was of dealing with this issue than
             does Illustrator... in InDesign, the rectangle is treated as an
             object, and its corner radius is treated as a property in just
             the same way as its width, height, and position... this means
             that you can change the corner radius at any time..."

         why does Illustrator make them such a pain? I did a quick Google
         search and found out how to create a rounded rectangle which can
         be scaled without affecting the corners. As with many simple tasks,
