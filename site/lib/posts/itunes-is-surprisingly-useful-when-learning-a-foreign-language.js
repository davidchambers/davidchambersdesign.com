I began by playing the audio files,\n             following along in the Danish transcripts. I found myself wanting\n             to listen to the difficult parts over and over, but scrubbing\n             through a timeline is rather awkward.']),
    p(['It occurred to me that I could use iTunes to solve this problem.\n             Normally, iTunes will play a track from beginning to end. It\'s\n             possible, though, to specify a certain portion of the track to be\n             played instead. By adding an audio file to a playlist many times\n             and specifying consecutive portions (e.g. 0:00\u20130:02, 0:02\u20130:04.8,\n             ...), a track can be broken into manageable clips for more\n             convenient navigation.']),
