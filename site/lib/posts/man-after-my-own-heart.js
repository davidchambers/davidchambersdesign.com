As was common with International Style\n             architects, Mies wanted the building to have a uniform\n             appearance. One aspect of a fa√ßade which Mies disliked,\n             was the disordered irregularity when window blinds are\n             drawn. Inevitably, people using different windows will\n             draw blinds to different heights, making the building\n             appear disorganized. To reduce this disproportionate\n             appearance, Mies specified window blinds which only\n             operated in three positions \u2013 fully open, halfway\n             open/closed, or fully closed.'])]),

The dimensions are\n             calculated in terms of the basic unit of the brick.'])])
