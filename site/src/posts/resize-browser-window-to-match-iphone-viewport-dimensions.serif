      the iPhone and iPod touch. While nothing beats testing on
      the device itself, I often find it quicker to test changes
      on my Mac. Changing the user agent string is a piece of cake
      in Safari (Develop > User Agent > Mobile Safari) but what
      about adjusting the browser window's dimensions to match
      those of the iPhone?",
