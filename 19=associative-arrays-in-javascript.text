# Associative arrays in JavaScript

**JavaScript does not have associative arrays.** (This will be old news
to many.)

Confusion arises from the fact that array syntax in JavaScript is very
similar to array syntax in PHP, a language that _does_ have associative
arrays. Additionally, **any object in JavaScript can be treated as an
associative array**. This means that if one creates a JavaScript `Array`
object and proceeds to use PHP's associative array syntax in an attempt
to add items to it, one _will_ succeed in assigning it attributeâ€“value
pairs. The object in question need not be an `Array` for this to work,
though, so for the sake of clarity using a vanilla `Object` is advisable.

To gain a more detailed understanding of why
JavaScript _appears_ to have associative arrays, read
[JavaScript "Associative Arrays" Considered Harmful][1].
