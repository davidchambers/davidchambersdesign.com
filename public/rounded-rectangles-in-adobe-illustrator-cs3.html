          <p>Not so long ago I was talking to my brother online as he worked on a poster for a presentation. He is an engineer; using Illustrator was a new experience for him. He generally picks up new things easily, but as you may appreciate, Illustrator is often far from logical. We reached a point where he asked me about scaling rounded rectangles – this is where things started to get hairy.</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="interviewer"><strong>him:</strong> if I have a rounded rectangle and resize it, it there a way to stop it from changing the rounding of the corners (which I want constant for all my rectangles)?</li>
            <li><strong>me:</strong> you can work out how large you want it to be and then double-click with the rectangle tool and you'll be able to enter all the correct values</li>
            <li><strong>him:</strong> is there a way to change how curved they are after placing them?</li>
            <li><strong>me:</strong> InDesign has a much better was of dealing with this issue than does Illustrator... in InDesign, the rectangle is treated as an object, and its corner radius is treated as a property in just the same way as its width, height, and position... this means that you can change the corner radius at any time...</li>
            <li><strong>him:</strong> that's how it should be</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Hmm. Since InDesign deals with rounded rectangles effortlessly, why does Illustrator make them such a pain? I did a quick Google search and found out how to create a rounded rectangle which can be scaled without affecting the corners. As with many simple tasks, Illustrator requires the user to carry out several steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>draw a rectangle of any size</li>
            <li>select it and go to <strong>Effect</strong> &gt; <strong>Convert to Shape</strong> &gt; <strong>Rounded Rectangle...</strong></li>
            <li>in the <strong>Shape Options</strong> dialogue, check the <strong>Relative</strong> radio button, and set <strong>Extra Width</strong> and <strong>Extra Height</strong> to 0</li>
            <li>enter your desired corner radius, and off you go!</li>
          </ol>
          <dl>
            <dt><img alt="Illustrator's Shape Options dialog" src="/images/posts/windows/illustrator-shape-options-dialog.png" />
</dt>
            <dd>Illustrator's <strong>Shape Options</strong> dialog, set up to enable rounded rectangles which scale correctly</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Now that the shape has been converted to a rounded rectangle, the <strong>Shape Options</strong> dialog can be accessed by double-clicking on <strong>Rounded Rectangle</strong> in the <strong>Appearance</strong> palette.</p>
