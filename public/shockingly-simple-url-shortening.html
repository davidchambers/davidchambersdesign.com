<p>URL shortening is something that's been at the back of my mind since listening
to <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/08/22/podcast-24-those-frames-are-ironic/">SitePoint Podcast #24</a> which discussed the near closure of <a href="http://tr.im/">tr.im</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why are short URLs required?</em> Twitter.</strong> Tweets are limited to 140
characters, and URLs often seem recklessly long in this context. Of course,
Twitter could simply allow us to apply short, meaningful labels to our links
as we've been doing in HTML for years. Instead, each time one includes a link
in a tweet one must either:</p>
<ul>
<li>spend a large number of characters on the full URL; or</li>
<li>use a short URL generated by a service such as <a href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I'm opposed to short URLs for several reasons. First, I believe that every
reference to a resource should use that resource's Uniform Resource Identifier
(if it has one) in its normalized form. In other words, we should <em>not</em> use
<strong>http://www.wikipedia.org/</strong> to refer to <strong>http://wikipedia.org/</strong>, and we
should <em>certainly not</em> use <strong>http://bit.ly/8RTk</strong>. Having multiple URLs for
a resource is a maintenance nightmare (unless one is willing to accept URLs
being temporal).</p>
<p>Secondly, I have a simple rule: <strong>meaningful &gt; meaningless</strong>. Meaningful markup
is wonderful, and meaningful URLs offer similar benefits (to both people and
search engines).</p>
<p>Finally — and this point relates to URL shortening services rather than to
short URLs themselves — there's no guarantee that sites which <em>currently</em>
provide a service will continue to do so indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Enter John Gruber</h3>
<p>I noticed one day that <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> now has its own <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/snaplog.com/wiki/short_url">shorturl</a>s,
using the incredibly cool domain name ✪df.ws. This got me thinking that perhaps
I should procure a short domain name and do something similar. Well, last week
I did.</p>
<p>With dċd.ws safely registered in my name I began looking for an open source
URL shortener to run on that domain. I then struck upon a <strong>simple, elegant
solution</strong> which took all of ten minutes to implement.</p>
<pre><code>:::apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://davidchambersdesign.com/$1 [R=301,L]
</code></pre>
<p>The code above forms the entirety of the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file on the
dċd.ws server. All it does is redirect every request to the corresponding
davidchambersdesign.com URL. The key word being <em>every</em>. As a result,
existing pages on this site gained short_er_ (though not necessarily short)
URLs automatically, and new pages gain a short URL the instant they are
published. <strong>No maintenance, no fuss. Nice!</strong></p>
<p>So, for example, <strong>http://dċd.ws/twitter/</strong> →
<strong>http://davidchambersdesign.com/twitter/</strong> (a 17 character saving).</p>
<p>If you're interested in acquiring your own short domain name, I suggest
trying .ws as it's one of the few top level domains to allow virtually any
Unicode character in its domain names. As a result, there are plenty of short
.ws domain names available. I don't suggest this approach for normal use,
however, as browsers will display something like <strong>http://xn--dd-7la.ws/</strong>
in their address bars.</p>
