<hr />
<p>I've been writing code for a few years now, but this year I made a concerted
effort to improve not just the quality of the code I write, but also by
proficiency with the computer in general. In no particular, here are the
changes I've made to the way in which I do things.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Switching from Coda to Vim</h3>
<p>I'd been a happy Coda user for several years, but as I strove to hide as many
parts of its user interface as possible it became apparent that I was spending
several hours each day typing into what was effectively TextEdit with syntax
highlighting.</p>
<p>I was writing Python at the time, so my options were to switch to an IDE such
as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> or one of the Unix stalwarts (Emacs and Vim). I opted to learn
Vim and I'm extremely pleased with the decision. I now spend around three
quarters of my time writing CoffeeScript and the rest writing prose, and the
time I've spent learning Vim is just as applicable today as it was when I
wrote a lot of Python.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of my current setup:</p>
<p>TODO: insert screenshot</p>
<h3>Creating a dotfiles repo</h3>
<p>I've had two computers for the past couple of years. This can be problematic
I one likes to customize one's environment. A popular solution to this problem
is to store configuration files — so called “dotfiles” — in a repository.
This year I created my own <a href="https://bitbucket.org/davidchambers/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a>.</p>
<h3>Using option as meta key in Terminal</h3>
<p><strong>Terminal</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Keyboard</strong> &gt; <strong>Use option as meta key</strong></p>
<p>This enables wordwise movement (&#8997;&#8592; and &#8997;&#8594;) and
deletion (&#8997;&#9003;). I can't believe it took me so many years to
discover this checkbox!</p>
<h3>Making bash prompt useful (time, path, branch name)</h3>
<p><img alt="Default Bash prompt" src="/images/posts/95/windows/lion/default-bash-prompt.png" /></p>
<p>The default bash prompt (as seen above) lacks the most fundamental piece of
information: <em>Where the hell am I?</em> Sure, it includes the name of the current
directory, but directory names such as “assets” and “src” are common</p>
<p><img alt="Custom Bash prompt" src="/images/posts/95/windows/lion/custom-bash-prompt.png" /></p>
<h3>Going from two monitors to one</h3>
<p>I was never really happy with two monitors: two large monitors in landscape
orientation seem preposterously wide to me, and adjacent monitors in portrait
work well in theory, but feel weird.</p>
<p>More significantly, I seem to get more done when I can see less. I've spent
many hours working on my 11-inch MacBook Air, and its the smallness rather
than the inability to have multiple apps visible at once that bothers me.</p>
<ul>
<li>making everything BIG</li>
</ul>
<h1>Switching from Mercurial to Git</h1>
<p>Mercurial was the first version control system I learnt, and I rate it highly.
As I became more active in the open-source community, where the majority of
projects live in Git repositories, switching between the two mental models
(and they are very different mental models) became a source of friction.</p>
<h3>Better shifting</h3>
<p><a href="http://stevelosh.com/">Steve Losh</a> recently published a tremendously detailed post,
<a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/">A Modern Space Cadet</a>, in which he covers the various tweaks he's made to
his hardware, software, and work habits in an effort “to make [his] typing
experience more pleasant and efficient”.</p>
<p>In the post Steve states that he used to use the <em>left</em> shift key exclusively.
I had the same bad habit, but it wasn't until I read this post that I realized
it's not to late to fix it. It took me several weeks with <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/#shift-key-training-wheels">training wheels</a>
to make the change, but I consider it time well spent.</p>

<h3>Abandoning Podcasts.app</h3>
<p>Earlier versions of iOS gave podcasts a tab in the Music app. Now, Apple ships
a dedicated Podcast app. It never worked well for me: podcasts would often
stop in midstream, and sometimes nothing short of rebooting the OS would coax
the app into resuming playback. I few months ago I switched to <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a>
and I'm very happy with it. Funnily enough one of the things I most enjoy
about not using Podcast.app is that I no longer have any podcasts in iTunes.
The fewer things to sync the better.</p>
