Resize browser window to match iPhone viewport dimensions
=========================================================

| I've recently become interested in optimizing sites for the iPhone and
| iPod touch. While nothing beats testing on the device itself, I often find it
| quicker to test changes on my Mac. Changing the user agent string is a piece
| of cake in Safari (Develop > User Agent > Mobile Safari) but what about
| adjusting the browser window's dimensions to match those of the iPhone?
| 
| I've created two bookmarklets to allow the current page to be loaded in an
| iPhone-sized window with a single click:
| 
| * **Portrait** (labelled "‚Åë")
| 
|         javascript:open(location,'iPhone:portrait','innerWidth='+(320+15)+',innerHeight='+(480+15)+',scrollbars=yes');
| 
| * **Landscape** (labelled "**")
| 
|         javascript:open(location,'iPhone:landscape','innerWidth='+(480+15)+',innerHeight='+(320+15)+',scrollbars=yes');

It appears that I need to rework this site's style sheet to better present
content in these smaller viewports!
