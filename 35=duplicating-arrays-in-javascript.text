# Duplicating arrays in JavaScript

Many of those who write JavaScript do not come from programming backgrounds
(while I've written plenty of PHP, Python, and JavaScript, I don't have much
experience with "real" programming languages[*](#footnote)). As a result, a
significant portion of JavaScript coders do not think of variables as pointers
to memory addresses. This leads to confusion in cases such as this:

    var fruits = ['orange', 'lime'];
    var colours = fruits; // na√Øve attempt to duplicate array
    colours.push('yellow');

One might be surprised to learn that `fruits` now contains not just "orange"
and "lime" but also "yellow". Oops! Here's how it went wrong:

    var fruits = ['orange', 'lime'];
    // fruits points to array containing "orange" and "lime"
    
    var colours = fruits;
    // colours now points to that same array!

How, then, does one create a copy of the original array? _Slice!_

    var colours = fruits.slice();
