Django syntax highlighting for Coda
===================================

I love [Coda][1]. It's just so... sexy, somehow. I've just discovered
[Django][2], with which I'm fast falling in love as well. Naturally, when I
came to write my first Django template I opened Coda.app and started coding.

It soon became apparent, however, that **Coda does not apply syntax
highlighting to Django**. The solution? Juan Pablo Claude's
[Django and Django-template bundles for Coda][3].
