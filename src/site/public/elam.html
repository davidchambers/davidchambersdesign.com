          <p>I attended Elam School of Fine Arts in Auckland between 2002 and 2005. After the general first-year course I majored in graphic design. Below are examples of the work I produced as part of that programme.</p>

          <h4>Gameplayer brand identity</h4>
          <p><b>Brief.</b> Design a brand identity for Gameplayer, a company that runs tournaments in Auckland for four trading card games: <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, <i>Duel Masters</i>, <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> and <i>VS System</i>. The identity must appeal to those between 12 and 24 years of age, without marginalizing older players of the games.</p>
          <p><img alt="Gameplayer business card (James)" src="/images/elam/gameplayer-business-card-james.png" /></p>
          <p><img alt="Gameplayer business card (Cici)" src="/images/elam/gameplayer-business-card-cici.png" /></p>
          <p><img alt="Gameplayer promotional card" src="/images/elam/gameplayer-promotional-card.png" /></p>
          <h4>Playing card design</h4>
          <p>Playing cards are an example of graphic design in its purest form. Balance, composition and consistency are all vitally important ingredients in playing card design. Typography, too, plays an important role.</p>
          <p>Rockwell was used as the starting point for the characters on each card. As an eccentric, slab-serif typeface Rockwell has few applications, but the consistent weight and overall blackness of its letterforms make it suitable for this purpose. Several of the characters were tweaked to iron out idiosyncrasies: Rockwell's "A" is not symmetrical, for example. The "J" and the "Q" required complete remodelling.</p>
          <p>Geometry was the driving force behind the design of the suit symbols. Initially, the diamond was a square rotated forty-five degrees, and the heart-shaped element of the spade was identical in shape and size to the heart itself.</p>
          <p>It soon became apparent that geometry should not drive the design of the symbols – instead, the human eye should be the judge. Many adjustments were made on this basis: the heart was increased in size to bring its surface area close to that of the spade; the club's upper leaf was made slightly larger so that all three leaves appear equal in size; and all straight edges were given gentle concave curves to prevent them from "bulging".</p>
          <p><img alt="Playing cards" src="/images/elam/playing-cards.jpg" /></p>
          <h4><i>Exposure05</i> catalogue</h4>
          <p><b>Brief.</b> Design the catalogue for the annual end-of-year exposition organized by the University of Auckland Postgraduate Students' Association.</p>
          <p><img alt="Exposure magazine cover" src="/images/elam/exposure-cover.jpg" /></p>
          <p><img alt="Exposure magazine spread" src="/images/elam/exposure-spread.jpg" /></p>
          <h4>"Insight Drive"</h4>
          <p>While at Insight, I was asked to design the packaging for an unusual Christmas gift. Earlier in the year, Insight had sent branded model Mini Coopers to its most valued clients. These cars had proven extremely popular, so it was decided that a faster motor would be sent to each Mini owner at the end of the year (to get a little more mileage from the initiative). The engines themselves did not possess much aesthetic appeal, so the challenge was to package them in an exciting way.</p>
