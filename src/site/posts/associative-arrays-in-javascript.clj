       ["Confusion arises from the fact that array syntax in JavaScript is
         very similar to array syntax in PHP, a language that " (em "does") "
         have associative arrays. Additionally, " (strong "any object in
         JavaScript can be treated as an associative array") ". This means
         that if one creates a JavaScript " (code "Array") " object and
         proceeds to use PHP's associative array syntax in an attempt to
         add items to it, one " (em "will") " succeed in assigning it
         attributeâ€“value pairs. The object in question need not be an "
        (code "Array") " for this to work, though, so for the sake of
         clarity using a vanilla " (code "Object") " is advisable."])
