Remove textarea scrollbars in Internet Explorer
===============================================

I was delighted to discover this "trick" over on CSS-Tricks in a post titled
[Textarea Tricks][]. (See, Chris, I _do_ like you!)

Internet Explorer displays a (completely pointless) inactive scrollbar in empty
`textarea` elements, unlike other browsers which wait until a scrollbar is
actually _required_ before displaying it.

As it turns out, there's a dead simple way to prevent this, and once again its
everybody's friend `overflow` to the rescue.

    textarea { overflow: auto; }

The `overflow` property seems to be a magical remedy for a variety of different
ailments, most significant of which is the collapsing of an element whose
children are all floated. Applying `overflow: auto` makes the element wrap its
children rather than letting them "hang".

One thing that I sometimes ponder, though, is why `visible` was selected as the
default `overflow` value â€“ it seems inferior to `auto` in most use cases.
