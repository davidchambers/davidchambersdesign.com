      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p>There are many well-designed programming languages in existence. Why create a new one?</p>
      <p>Before explaining my reasons I must share a few things about myself. While studying graphic design at university I became interested in web development. In 2008 I began to learn Python, PHP, and JavaScript in order to build websites. In 2010 I began programming professionally. Since then I have become deeply involved in the JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
      <p>In 2015 I updated my website to read as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I <b>fight complexity</b> in the software industry.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m currently <b>fixing JavaScript</b>, which will take some time!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That same year I began developing <a href="https://sanctuary.js.org/">Sanctuary</a>, a functional programming library I viewed as the successor to <a href="https://ramdajs.com">Ramda</a>. Sanctuary exposed the JavaScript community to good ideas from functional programming languages: curried functions, parametric polymorphism, and algebraic data types.</p>
      <p>In 2020 I began developing a static site generator. I chose Node.js as the runtime so I could leverage Sanctuary and other JavaScript libraries I know and like.</p>
      <p>Creating a DSL in JavaScript was a frustrating experience; JSX exists because any JavaScript representation of an HTML document contains significant syntactic noise.</p>
