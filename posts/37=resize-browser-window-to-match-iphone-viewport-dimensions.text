# Resize browser window to match iPhone viewport dimensions

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I've recently become interested in optimizing sites for the iPhone and iPod
touch. While nothing beats testing on the device itself, I often find it
quicker to test changes on my Mac. Changing the user agent string is a piece
of cake in Safari (Develop > User Agent > Mobile Safari) but what about
adjusting the browser window's dimensions to match those of the iPhone?

I've created two bookmarklets to allow the current page to be loaded in an
iPhone-sized window with a single click:

* **Portrait** (labelled "‚Åë")

        javascript:open(location,'iPhone:portrait','innerWidth='+(320+15)+',innerHeight='+(480+15)+',scrollbars=yes');

* **Landscape** (labelled "**")

        javascript:open(location,'iPhone:landscape','innerWidth='+(480+15)+',innerHeight='+(320+15)+',scrollbars=yes');

![iPhone testing bookmarklets][1]
: iPhone testing bookmarklets: portrait and landscape

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

![Safari window resized to iPhone portrait dimensions][2]
: 320x480: iPhone portrait dimensions

![Safari window resized to iPhone landscape dimensions][3]
: 480x320: iPhone landscape dimensions

It appears that I need to rework this site's style sheet to better present
content in these smaller viewports!
