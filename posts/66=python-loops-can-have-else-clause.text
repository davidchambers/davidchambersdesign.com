# Python loops can have else clause?!

I write a lot of Python. I also write a lot of JavaScript. As I switch between
the two (often several times in a day) I sometimes find myself trying to do
something in one using the syntax of the other. The most common example is
joining a list.

Python:

    :::python
    ' '.join(['foo', 'bar'])

JavaScript:

    :::javascript
    ['foo', 'bar'].join(' ')

Often -- as is the case above -- the syntactical differences are minor, but
there are times when there's no direct translation.

[MooTools][1], for example, adds the [`every` method][2] to the `Array` object.
This makes it possible to write some rather terse conditional statements.

    :::javascript
    var numbers = [87, 33, 21, 75];
    if (numbers.every(function (n) { return n % 3 == 0; })) {
        window.alert('The numbers are all divisible by 3.');
    }

Python lists have no comparable method, so how would one write this in Python?

    :::python
    numbers = [87, 33, 21, 75]
    if [n for n in numbers if n % 3 == 0] == numbers:
        print 'The numbers are all divisible by 3.'

This approach involves using a list comprehension to create a list of numbers
which are divisible by 3, and comparing this list to `numbers`. If the lists
are equal, everything in `numbers` is divisible by 3.

As [Rafael Almeida pointed out on Twitter][3], there *is* an elegant way to
express this in Python:

    :::python
    if all((n % 3 == 0 for n in numbers)):
        print 'The numbers are all divisible by 3.'

### Now for something a bit more challenging

Assume that we have a list of documents, and we want to know which of the
documents contain all the terms in a list of search terms.

    :::javascript
    // (MooTools) JavaScript
    
    var terms = ['python', 'list', 'methods'], matches = [];
    documents.each(function (document) {
        if (terms.every(function (term) {
            return document.body.indexOf(term) != -1;
        })) matches.append(document);
    });

Here, we _could_ use the list comprehension approach as before.

    :::python
    # Python
    
    terms = ['python', 'list', 'methods']
    matches = []
    for document in documents:
        if [t for t in terms if document.body.find(t) != -1] == terms:
            matches.append(document)

This is reasonably succinct, but not terribly efficient since each document is
checked for _every_ search term. Given that we're not interested in documents
that lack even a single search term, it should be possible to rewrite this code
so that we don't waste time on lost causes.

It turns out that Python has just the thing for the job: **in Python, a loop
statements may have an `else` clause!**

    :::python
    terms = ['python', 'list', 'methods']
    matches = []
    for document in documents:
        for term in terms:
            if document.body.find(term) == -1:
                break
        else: # every term was found
            matches.append(document)

From [4. More Control Flow Tools][4]:

> Loop statements may have an `else` clause; it is executed when the
> loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with `for`) or when
> the condition becomes false (with `while`), but not when the loop is
> terminated by a `break` statement.

**I'm looking forward to finding more good spots to make use of `else`
clauses with my Python loops.** :D
