# Valid XHTML alternative to `<strike>`

Today I noticed that a page on this site failed validation.
[W3C's markup validation service][1] gave the following error:

    element "strike" undefined

`<strike>` is not valid XHTML; I'd forgotten the correct XHTML markup for
this purpose:

    :::html
    my favourite colour is <del>red</del> <ins>white</ins>

The above gives: my favourite colour is <del>red</del> <ins>white</ins>

It's a good idea to explicitly define the appearance of deleted and inserted
text in your style sheet:

    :::css
    del { text-decoration: line-through; }
    ins { text-decoration: underline; }
